Domain Reconnaissance Tool
A comprehensive Python-based tool for performing domain reconnaissance, gathering information about subdomains, DNS records, SSL certificates, security headers, typosquatting, co-hosted domains, and more. The tool leverages various libraries and external services to provide detailed insights into a target domain's infrastructure and security posture.
Features

Subdomain Enumeration: Uses subfinder to discover subdomains and checks their status (active/inactive).
Subdomain Takeover Detection: Identifies potential subdomain takeover vulnerabilities using the takeover tool.
SSL/TLS Analysis:
Checks SSL certificate validity and expiry dates.
Identifies SSL/TLS vulnerabilities (e.g., deprecated protocols, weak ciphers, Heartbleed).


Security Headers Check: Analyzes HTTP security headers (e.g., CSP, HSTS) for active domains.
DNS Records:
Retrieves MX records.
Checks email security records (SPF, DMARC, DKIM).
Analyzes DNS security features (DNSSEC, CAA, NS, etc.).


Typosquatting Detection: Generates and checks typosquatted domain variants for potential abuse.
Co-hosted Domains: Identifies domains hosted on the same IP addresses as the target domain.
WHOIS Information: Retrieves domain registration details.
Technology Stack Analysis: Uses Wappalyzer to detect technologies and their versions.
API Key Scanning: Scans JavaScript files for exposed API keys and secrets.
Shodan Integration: Performs Shodan scans to identify open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.
Results Export: Saves results in both text and CSV formats for easy analysis.

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
External Tools:
subfinder: For subdomain enumeration.
takeover: For subdomain takeover checks.


API Access:
Shodan API key for Shodan scans (optional, required for Shodan integration).
HackerTarget API for reverse IP lookups (free tier available).


System Dependencies:
Ensure subfinder and takeover binaries are installed and accessible in your system's PATH.



Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/domain-recon-tool.git
cd domain-recon-tool


Install Python dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Install subfinder:

Follow instructions from subfinder's GitHub page.
Ensure the subfinder binary is in your PATH or specify its path in the script.


Install takeover:

Follow instructions from takeover's GitHub page.
Ensure the takeover binary is in your PATH.


(Optional) Set up Shodan API:

Obtain a Shodan API key from shodan.io.
Configure the API key in the shodan_scanner.py script or environment variables.



Requirements
Create a requirements.txt file with the following dependencies:
python-whois
dnspython
requests
colorama
wappalyzer
beautifulsoup4
urllib3

Install them using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Run the tool and follow the prompts:
python recon_tool.py


Enter the target domain (e.g., example.com).
The tool will perform reconnaissance in multiple phases, including:
Subdomain enumeration
Subdomain takeover checks
SSL/TLS analysis
Security headers analysis
DNS and email security checks
Typosquatting detection
Co-hosted domain analysis
WHOIS lookup
Technology stack detection
API key scanning
Shodan scanning


Results are displayed in the terminal and saved to both a text file (recon_<domain>_<timestamp>.txt) and a CSV file (recon_<domain>_<timestamp>.csv).
Choose to scan another domain or exit.

Example Output
üîç Domain Reconnaissance Tool
========================================
üîç Enter a domain name (e.g., example.com): example.com

[*] Phase 1: Running Subdomain Enumeration and SSL Checks...
[+] Total subdomains found: 25
[+] Active domains: 10
[-] Inactive domains: 15

[*] Phase 2: Checking for Subdomain Takeover...
[!] Potential takeover found: vuln-sub.example.com

[*] Phase 3: Checking SSL Vulnerabilities...
example.com: No vulnerabilities detected ‚úÖ
sub.example.com: Deprecated protocol: TLSv1 ‚ùå

...

[+] Detailed results saved to recon_example.com_20250417_123456.txt
[+] CSV results saved to recon_example.com_20250417_123456.csv
üîÅ Check another domain? (y/n):

Output Files

Text Report: A detailed report with formatted sections for each reconnaissance phase.
CSV Report: A structured CSV file for easy data analysis in spreadsheets or scripts.

Notes

Rate Limiting: The tool includes delays to avoid overwhelming APIs or triggering rate limits (e.g., HackerTarget, Shodan).
Error Handling: Extensive error handling ensures the tool continues running even if individual checks fail.
Parallel Processing: Uses concurrent.futures for efficient parallel execution of checks.
Security: Disables SSL warnings for testing purposes (urllib3.disable_warnings). Use with caution in production environments.
Dependencies: Ensure external tools (subfinder, takeover) are properly installed and configured.
Shodan: Requires a valid Shodan API key for full functionality. Without it, the Shodan scan phase will be skipped or limited.

Limitations

Some checks (e.g., HackerTarget API, Shodan) may be rate-limited or require paid accounts for extensive use.
Subdomain takeover detection depends on the takeover tool's accuracy and configuration.
API key scanning is pattern-based and may produce false positives or miss custom key formats.
DNS and SSL checks may fail for domains with non-standard configurations or restrictive firewalls.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please submit issues or pull requests to improve the tool. Areas for enhancement include:

Adding support for additional reconnaissance tools.
Improving API key detection patterns.
Enhancing performance for large domain lists.
Adding visualization for results (e.g., graphs, charts).
